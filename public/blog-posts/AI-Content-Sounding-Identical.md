⚠️ Is Your AI Content Sounding .... Identical?
---

Have you ever felt like every piece of LLM-generated text - from a blog post to an email draft or when you are typing out essays for school- is starting to sound like same, polished, refined "AI voice"? In the research area, it is called 𝘿𝙞𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙞𝙩𝙮 𝘾𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙖𝙥𝙨𝙚 in LLMs.
I came across Gil's post ([https://lnkd.in/eBgN6nEK]) - and it seemed like a phenomenon. Are we are sacrificing the richness and individuality of human expression for scale and 'perfection.'? 

- The Data Backs It Up 📉 
I read couple of papers to get a clarity on this topic. The paper "A Comprehensive Analysis of Large Language Model Outputs: Similarity, Diversity, and Bias " by Smith et al. (2025) ([https://lnkd.in/ezUfwUh4]) lays out the problem perfectly.

1. Consistency vs. Uniqueness: The texts produced by the same LLMs show higher consistency and similarity in their outputs compared to human-written texts. Humans simply write more uniquely.

2. Typical AI Mindset: 
Models like Llama 3 and Mistral display high inter-model writing similarity - they're starting to sound like siblings. GPT-4, however, stands out for its distinctiveness.

3. The Human Edge:
𝘏𝘶𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘩𝘪𝘣𝘪𝘵 𝘭𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥-𝘭𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘢𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘯 𝘓𝘓𝘔𝘴. That's the hallmark of unique, individualistic style.
Human-written text shows the least similarity to all LLMs overall. Our writing remains distinct.

4. Complexity ≠ Quality:
The most surprising finding relates to Readability:
𝘏𝘶𝘮𝘢𝘯 𝘸𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦𝘳 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦. LLMs (like GPT-4) produce more complex and challenging, characterized by a higher frequency of difficult vocabulary.
