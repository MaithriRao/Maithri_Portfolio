## 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥:
- Traditional AI agents operate based on predefined rules, limiting responses to what is explicitly written.
- Agentic AI utilizes model-driven reasoning loops, enabling dynamic plan generation and adjustment on the go.

## 𝐀𝐝𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲:
- Classic agents adhere to fixed steps, while Agentic AI monitors intermediate outcomes, identifies deviations, and recalibrates plans accordingly.
- For instance, a rule-based maintenance assistant may falter if a specific vehicle fault code is absent. In contrast, an agentic system can source additional information, reconsider the context, and propose an updated diagnostic approach.

## 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐂𝐚𝐩𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲:
- Older agents are task-specific.
- Agentic AI inherits broad generalization from foundation models, allowing the same system to interpret instructions, search tools, and coordinate actions across different tasks.

The transition from rigid agents to adaptive agentic systems marks a shift toward architectures that can plan, act, and self-correct in complex workflows.
